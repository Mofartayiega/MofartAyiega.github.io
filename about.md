I am originally from Kisii, Kenya. Before starting my PhD at Michigan State University in 2023, I earned a BEd (Arts) in Kiswahili and History from Kibabii University (2018) and an MA in Swahili (Linguistics) from Kenyatta University (2022).

After my MA, I worked as an adjunct faculty member at Daystar University, teaching introductory courses in Swahili phonology, phonetics, morphology, semantics, and sociolinguistics.

My MA thesis, supervised by Dr. Leonard Chacha Mwita, examined Bracket Erasure Rule violations in Swahili compound nouns within Lexical Morphology. Using data from Swahili dictionary (BAKITA,2015)*, I found that violations of the Bracket Erasure Rule in Kiswahili compound nouns occur when the second constituent remains accessible to the first after compounding, allowing internal morphological changes. These violations are also shaped by the contextual and communicative use of the compounds in everyday language. This challenges the assumption that word-formation rules cannot access internal structure after compounding and has implications for Swahili morphology and lexicography.
