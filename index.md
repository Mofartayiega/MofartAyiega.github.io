I am currently a PhD student in linguistics in the [Department of Linguistics, Languages, and Cultures](https://linglang.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University. I am primarily interested in sociolinguistics and morphosyntax, with a focus on Bantu languages; particularly Swahili and Ekegusii. My work investigates how semantic features (e.g., animacy) interact with grammatical structure across domains,how language varies and changes across communities, and Tense and Suffix order in Ekegusii.
I currently work with [Deo Ngonyani](https://linglang.msu.edu/people/deo-ngonyani/), [Suzanne Wagner](https://wagnersu.msu.domains), and [Alan Ke](https://alan-ke.com) on projects involving variation, agreement, and morphosemantics.
